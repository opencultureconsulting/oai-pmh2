# The default configuration
#
# Copy this file as 'config.yml' and change the settings to your preferences.
# See https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm for further
# explanation.
#

#
# A human readable name for the repository
#
repositoryName: 'OAI-PMH 2.0 Data Provider'

#
# Email address for contacting the repository owner
#
# This has to be a valid email according to RFC 822 Address Specification.
#
adminEmail: 'admin@example.org'

#
# Database connection details
#
# This has to be a valid data source name (DSN) URI. The scheme is used to
# specify a driver, the user and password in the URI encode user and password
# for the connection, followed by the host and port parts. The path after the
# authority part represents the name of the database (the leading slash is
# removed so add an extra slash to specify an absolute file path for SQLite).
# The placeholder "%BASEDIR%" may be used to represent the application's base
# directory.
# Any optional query parameters are used as additional connection parameters.
# Since the scheme determines the database driver, it also specifies if the PDO
# abstraction ("mariadb", "mssql", "mysql", "oracle", "postgresql", "sqlite")
# or native drivers ("ibm-db2", "mysqli", "oci8", "pgsql", "sqlite3", "sqlsrv")
# should be used to handle the connection. Make sure the corresponding PHP
# extensions are installed.
#
# %DRIVER%://[[%USER%[:%PASSWORD%]@]%HOST%[:%PORT%]]/%DBNAME%[?%OPTIONS%]
#
# Examples:
# database: 'mssql://oaipmh:secret@127.0.0.1/oaipmh'
# database: 'mysql://root@localhost/oai?charset=utf8mb4'
# database: 'pgsql://oaipmh:secret@localhost:5432/oai_data_provider'
# database: 'sqlite3:////opt/oaipmh/database.db'
#
# Run "bin/cli orm:schema-tool:update --force" and "bin/cli oai:update:formats"
# after switching to a new DB to test the settings and initialize the database!
#
database: 'sqlite3:///%BASEDIR%/data/sqlite3.db'

#
# Metadata formats, namespaces and schemas of your records
#
# The default is 'oai_dc' which is also required by the OAI-PMH specification,
# but technically you can provide any XML based data formats you want. Just add
# another entry with the metadata prefix as key and namespace/schema URIs as
# array values or replace the default entry (although not recommended).
# You do not have to provide every record in each metadata format, but if you
# have the same record in multiple formats, it's highly recommended to use the
# same identifier for all versions of the record.
#
# Run "bin/cli oai:update:formats" after changing metadata prefixes to update
# the database accordingly!
#
metadataPrefix: {
    oai_dc: {
        namespace: 'http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/',
        schema: 'https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd'
    }
}

#
# Deleted records policy
#
# This states if and how the repository keeps track of deleted records. You can
# delete records by importing empty records with the same identifiers and
# metadata prefixes. Depending on the deleted records policy those records will
# be either marked as deleted or completely removed from the database.
# Valid options are:
# "no" - The repository does not provide any information about deletions and
# deleted records are completely removed from the database.
# "persistent" - The repository provides consistent information about deletions
# and placeholders for deleted records are kept in the database.
# "transient" - The repository may provide information about deletions. This is
# handled exactly the same as "persistent", but you are allowed to manually
# prune deleted records from the database (see below).
#
# ["no"|"persistent"|"transient"]
#
# Run "bin/cli oai:prune:records" after changing the deleted records policy to
# "no" to remove all deleted records from the database.
# If your policy is "transient" and you want to clean up deleted records from
# the database anyway, run the command with the "--force" flag.
#
deletedRecords: 'transient'

#
# Maximum number of records to return per request
#
# For larger result sets resumption tokens are provided repeatedly, which
# allow requesting more batches of records until the set is complete.
#
# [1 - 100]
#
maxRecords: 50

#
# Number of seconds a resumption token should be valid
#
# [300 - 86400]
#
tokenValid: 1800 # 30 minutes

#
# Batch size for bulk imports
#
# When importing large amounts of records, PHP memory consumption becomes a
# concern. Here you can configure how many records should be kept in memory
# before flushing to database and starting the next batch.
# The default setting (0) means the application dynamically allocates batches
# by monitoring its memory consumption. While this is the most efficient mode
# and will work fine in most environments, it can potentially lead to fatal
# errors due to memory exhaustion. If you encounter those, you can set a safe
# hard limit for the batch size instead.
#
# [0 - ?]
#
batchSize: 0

#
# Create sets automatically
#
# If enabled, the application will automatically create new sets when they are
# encountered the first time while importing records. Otherwise unknown sets
# will be ignored.
# Newly created sets will have the same set name as setSpec, but you can change
# the details later using the "bin/cli oai:update:set" command.
#
# [true|false]
#
autoSets: true
