#
# The upgrade configuration
#
# This file contains instructions for the "app:upgrade" command. It is specific
# to one release and should not be changed manually.
#

# During upgrade all files in the app's root directory are replaced by their
# newer version. Existing files and directories in the target directory which
# are not part of the new release are preserved. For directories this is
# handled individually based on the following configuration:
# - Only directories mentioned here are upgraded. Everything else is preserved.
# - Directories can either be mirrored or copied, based on their configuration.
#   "mirror" - The directory is overwritten recursively, all existing files are
#   either replaced by their respective newer version or deleted if they are
#   not part of the new release.
#   "copy" - The directory is copied recursively, all existing files are either
#   replaced by their respective newer version or preserved if they are not
#   part of the new release.

directories: {
    bin: 'mirror',
    config: 'copy',
    doc: 'mirror',
    public: 'copy',
    src: 'mirror'
